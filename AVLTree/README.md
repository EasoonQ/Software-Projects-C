This project contains the implementation of BST and AVL Tree. Also, it contains a program named scheduling, which will generate a plan for time-slots for exams.

In order, to compile, simply type "make", then an executable called scheduling will be generated.

To run, type "./scheduling [filename]", where the file should follow the the format as follow: 

Have three parameters on the first line: how many exams there are, how many students there are, and how many timeslots there are, separated by whitespace. 

Each successive line will have the name of a student (a string of lowercase letters), followed by the name of the classes that student is in (each one being an integer greater than 0).
